<p>The Ardeidae, or the family of herons,
egrets and bitterns, includes about seventy-five
species, which are world wide
in their distribution, though much more
common in temperate regions. So widely
scattered are the species of this family,
whose Latin name means heron, that
most persons who are deeply interested
in the study of bird life are more or
less familiar with their habits. The
large size of the herons, together with
their long bills, necks and legs, renders
them conspicuous and demands more
than a passing glance from even the casual
observer. Many bodies of water in
retired locations will harbor at the
proper season one or more species of
this interesting family.</p>
<p>One of the smallest of the herons, and
one of the most common in many localities,
is the Little Green Heron, familiarly
known to the rural Hoosier boy as the
&ldquo;Schytepoke,&rdquo; and to others as the
&ldquo;Poke.&rdquo; It is not the purpose to give a
description of this bird; those of our
readers&mdash;if there be any&mdash;who are not
familiar with it will find minute descriptions
of it in all the standard manuals.
However, a few observations on its nesting
and feeding habits may be of some
value and interest.</p>
<p>In central Indiana the Little Green
Heron arrives from its winter residence
in Florida, or farther southward, about
the last of April, and immediately begins
nesting, selecting, if convenient, second
growth timber, especially if there be a
thicket of undergrowth. But if these
conditions be not at hand, it seems to
prefer, as a site for its nest, an old
abandoned orchard, or at least one somewhat
remote from human habitation,
but not very far distant from a stream
or pond. In the fork of some tree ten
to twenty feet above ground is collected
a considerable sized but irregular and
loose bundle of rough sticks. In this by
the middle of May, or at times even earlier,
it lays from three to six greenish
blue eggs, about an inch and a half long
by an inch and a quarter in diameter.
The period of incubation cannot be long,
as some years young almost ready to fly
can be found before the last of May. We
have never found more than one nest
in the same immediate vicinity, but, according
to Ridgway, it sometimes nests
in colonies.</p>
<p>For the remainder of the summer this
is a social bird, at least to the extent that
the whole family remain together, wading
the water, stalking along the banks
or perching on trees, bushes and logs.
At this time it displays some curiosity
when a person comes warily into its
haunts. Its long neck is stretched to
its limit as the bird endeavors to keep
an eye on the intruder, and at the slightest
suspicious movement on the part of
the latter, its long wings are raised in
readiness for flight. Remain perfectly
quiet, however, and it again resumes its
occupation, apparently unconcerned; but
let a sudden movement be made, and
then it awkwardly but quickly flies away,
uttering meanwhile a discordant squawk.</p>

<p>It is quite interesting to see one of
these herons feeding. It will wade along
the edge of a pond or stream, very
slowly lifting its feet out of the water
and carefully putting them down again.
Its neck is folded so that it almost disappears,
the head being drawn back
against the shoulders. At last it sees
an unwary minnow swimming lazily
along. Slowly and carefully it leans its
body forward and downward toward the
water, the long legs looking and acting
almost like stilts; still more slowly the
head with its long, stout beak moves
cautiously toward the water surface, very
much like a young turkey seeks to capture
a grasshopper. Then suddenly, as
if a spring had been set free in its neck,
the head is thrust downward until the
beak, or more, disappears beneath the
surface, but only to reappear immediately
with the struggling minnow or sunfish
between its mandibles.</p>
<p>The prey secured, the bird now walks
to an open spot on the bank several feet
away, if possible, from the water so that
the fish cannot flop back into its native
element. With a blow or two from the
bird&rsquo;s bill the fish is stunned and in another
moment has started head first down
the heron&rsquo;s throat. As the latter stretches
its neck, the descent of the fish is plainly
to be seen until it reaches the body
of the bird. If the heron is not yet satisfied
with its meal, the same performance
is repeated until at last it flies to
some overhanging limb&mdash;usually a dead
one&mdash;of a tree where it wipes its bill and
finally flies away. By the last of August
or first of September it has gone on its
southern journey, and Indiana knows it
no more till spring.</p>

<h2 id="c4">THE GOBBLER WHO WAS LONESOME.
<br /><span class="small">A HISTORICAL FACT.</span></h2>
<p>Turkeys are social creatures and,
like some boys and girls, do not like to
be left for any length of time to find
their food or their pleasures alone.</p>
<p>Big Tom was a mammoth gobbler of
the bronze family, which stands high in
Turkeydom. Big Tom loved to have a
group of admiring mates and social
equals about when he spread his jaw and
sang his song. Some taller bipeds who
spoke a different language said that his
song of &ldquo;gobble-obble-obble&rdquo; was not
pleasing. This remark may have been
the reason why Big Tom&rsquo;s wattles grew
so scarlet each time he sang, but it is to
be doubted.</p>
<p>When the spring days had grown long
three hen turkeys came off their nests
with broods of turkey chicks, too valuable
to the farmer to be left entirely to
the turkey mother&rsquo;s judgment and care.
Hence these various broods, numbering
in all twenty-seven chicks, were penned
into tiny homes and fed on food furnished
by their master.</p>
<p>Big Tom watched these proceedings
for about one week, and then evidently
rebelled at the taking of his kingdom
away from him.</p>
<p>He first persuaded one brood to follow
him into a field where grasshoppers
bounded and abounded. This brood he
kept over night housed under his great
wings. His success pleased him, for in
a few days a second brood was discovered
to be missing, and two hen turkeys
were idling away their time talking over
their troubles or happiness through the
bars of their wooden prisons.</p>
<p>But the climax was reached when in
a distant field a few days later Big Tom
was found chaperoning a party of
twenty-seven young tourist turkeys of a
very tender age, through a field where
insect food was too plentiful for the
farmer&rsquo;s profit, but just right for sturdy
bronze turkeys, both young and old.</p>
<p>The farmer attempted to drive his
majesty, Big Tom, back to his quarters
near the barn, but the young turks disappeared
at their father&rsquo;s first warning
cluck or signal, and Big Tom showed
plainly that he resented interference with
his own plans for his children&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>The farmer returned to the house
alone and finding the three turkey hens
calmly gossiping through the slatted
fronts of their coops, gave them their
liberty, and went back to planting his
crop in the distant field, where he found
Big Tom happy with his party of young
adventurers.</p>
<p>Big Tom never allowed one turkey
chick to return night or day to its coop
or its mother. In the fall, the farmer
and his boys counted twenty-seven well
grown turkeys perched on the fence back
of the barn, with his majesty, their
father, half way down the line, where
his eyes could take in all their doings.</p>
<p>The hen turkeys had gone about their
own work, raised other broods and
brought them up in coops with various
losses, but Big Tom of the red wattles
has always been celebrated in that locality
from that year down to the present
date as the best manager of a turkey
ranch ever known.</p>
<p>At Thanksgiving time Big Tom&rsquo;s good
qualities were enumerated by a large
party gathered at the farmer&rsquo;s table, and
if his majesty could have heard the flattering
remarks his pride would have perhaps
caused him to give back an answering
&ldquo;gobble-obble-obble.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<h2 id="c5">THE VARIED THRUSH.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Hesperocichla naevia.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The Varied Thrush is one of the most
beautiful members of the family of
thrushes. Its range is somewhat limited
as it frequents only the coastal regions
of the northwestern part of North America.
In winter, however, it may be found
in California and is occasionally seen as
far south as Lower California. As a
straggler, it is sometimes noticed in the
New England states.</p>
<p>Mr. Mitchell says that the Varied
Thrush reaches the Columbia river in its
southward flight some time in October.
He also states that &ldquo;at this time they flit
through the forests in small flocks, usually
frequenting the low trees, on which
they perch in perfect silence and are at
times very timorous and difficult to approach,
having all the sly sagacity of the
robin.&rdquo; In fact this bird, which is often
called the Western Robin, is not only
much more shy and retiring than our
well known eastern friend, but their song
is also very different, &ldquo;consisting only
of five or six notes in a minor key and a
scale regularly descending.&rdquo; Mr. Townsend
speaks of the song as being louder,
sharper and quicker than that of the
robin and adds that its song just before
its northward flight, in the spring, is
pleasant. Its song is seldom heard except
from the tree tops, and in summer,
as a rule, only from the deeper forests.</p>
<p>Dr. Suckley describes the Varied
Thrush as he studied it in Oregon and
Washington. He says: &ldquo;In winter it
is a shy bird, not generally becoming
noticeable in the open districts until after
a fall of snow, when many individuals
may be seen along the sand beaches near
salt water. They are at such times tame
and abundant. I suppose that they are
driven out of the woods during the heavy
snows by hunger. It may then frequently
be found in company with the robin, with
which it has many similar habits. At
this time of the year it is a very silent
bird, quite tame and will allow near approach.
It appears to be fond of flying
by short stages in a desultory manner,
sometimes alighting on the ground, at
other times on fences, bushes or trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Cooper, speaking of the bird as
he found it near San Francisco, says that
they begin to appear in October, when
&ldquo;they are usually timid, but toward
spring come more familiarly around
houses and utter their shrill, low notes,
which seem much more distant than the
bird itself really is. If pursued they hide,
and sit unmovable among the foliage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bird is also known by several
other names, such as the Spotted, Golden,
Painted or Columbia Robin or Thrush,
and sometimes it is called the Thrush-like
Mockingbird. A marked characteristic
of the male is the black crescent on the
breast.</p>
<p>Mr. Davie describes the nest as found
by Dr. Minor in Alaska: &ldquo;Its base and
periphery are composed of an elaborate
basket-work of slender twigs. Within
these is an inner nest consisting of an
interweaving of fine dry grasses and
long gray lichen.&rdquo; The eggs are said
to be a light greenish-blue, slightly
sprinkled with spots of a dark umber-brown.</p>

<h2 id="c6">MISSOURI SKYLARK.

<p class="t">Drops so bright to see,</p>
<p class="t0">As from thy presence showers a rain of melody.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr">&mdash;Shelley.</p>
</div>
<p>When the umber skylark is struck into
glory of plume and of song by the rising
sun, we can conceive that the song is indeed
&ldquo;the nearest approach, in animal
nature, to the ringing of the hydrogen
bells in the physics of light,&rdquo; and that
when &ldquo;the music soars within the little
lark and the lark soars,&rdquo; he is almost an
involuntary agent, the song, like the summer,
owing its creation, as George MacDonald
tells, to</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The sun that rises early,</p>
<p class="t0">Shining, shining all day rarely;</p>
<p class="t0">Drawing up the larks to meet him,</p>
<p class="t0">Earth&rsquo;s bird-angels, wild to greet him.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Although the skylark, more than any
other of the aerial tribes, &ldquo;holds the middle
rank &rsquo;twixt heaven and earth, on the
last verge of mortal being stand,&rdquo; the fate
of the Missouri skylark is more unhappy
than that of a prophet, for, being so little
known in comparison with his deserts,
he is almost without honor in his own
country or any other. Yet it was so long
ago as May 19, 1843, that Audubon, near
the headwaters of the Missouri, celebrated
in his journal the glad tidings of
his discovery: &ldquo;Harris and Bell have
returned, and, to my delight and utter
astonishment, have brought two new
birds, one a lark, small and beautiful.&rdquo;
And again, on June 22, he writes: &ldquo;The
little new lark, that I have named for
Sprague, has almost all the habits of the
skylark of Europe. Whilst looking anxiously
for it on the ground, where we
supposed it to be singing, we discovered
it to be high over our heads, and that
sometimes it went too high for us to see
at all. When this species start from the
ground they fly in succession of undulations,
which renders aim at them quite
difficult. After this, and in the same manner,
they elevate themselves to some considerable
height, as if about to sing, and
presently pitch toward the ground, where
they run prettily, and at times stand still
and quite erect for a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On June 24 he continues: &ldquo;This afternoon
I thought would be a fair opportunity
to examine the manners of
Sprague&rsquo;s lark on the wing. The male
rises, by constant undulations, to a great
height, say one hundred yards or more;
and, whilst singing its sweetest sounding
notes, beats its wings, poised in the air
like a hawk, without rising at this time,
after which, and after each burst of singing,
it sails in divers directions, forming
three-quarters of a circle or thereabouts,
then rises again, and again sings.
The intervals between the singing are
longer than those the song occupies (the
latter about fifteen to twenty minutes),
and at times the bird remains so long in
the air as to render it quite fatiguing
to follow it with the eye. Sprague
thought one he watched yesterday remained
in the air about an hour. Bell
and Harris watched one for more than
half an hour, and this afternoon I gazed
upon one, whilst Bell timed it, for thirty-six
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In November, 1873, Dr. Coues discovered
this pipit in considerable numbers,
and continues Audubon&rsquo;s enthusiastic description:
The ordinary straightforward
flight of the bird is performed with
a regular rising and falling like that of
the titlark; but its course, when startled
from the ground, is exceedingly rapid
and wayward. At such times, after the
first alarm, they are wont to hover around
in a desultory manner for a considerable
time and then pitch suddenly down to the
ground, often near where they rose. Under
these circumstances they have a lisping,
querulous note. But these common
traits have nothing to do with the wonderful
soaring action and the inimitable,
matchless song of the birds during the
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
breeding season. It is no wonder Audubon
grew enthusiastic in describing it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rising from the nest or from its
grassy bed, this plain-looking little bird,
clad in the simplest colors, and making
but a speck in the boundless expanse,
mounts straight up on tremulous wings,
until lost to view in the blue ether, and
then sends back to earth a song of gladness
that seems to come from the sky
itself, to cheer the weary, give hope to
the disheartened, and turn the most indifferent,
for the moment at least, from
sordid thoughts. No other bird music
heard in our land compares with the wonderful
strains of this songster; there is
something not of earth in the melody,
coming from above, yet from no visible
source. The notes are simply indescribable;
but once heard they can never be
forgotten. Their volume and penetration
are truly wonderful. They are neither
loud nor strong, yet the whole air
seems filled with the tender strains and
the delightful melody continues long unbroken.
The song is only heard for a
brief period in the summer, ceasing when
the inspiration of the love season is over,
and it is only uttered when the birds are
soaring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baird, Brewer and Ridgway tell that
Captain Blackiston found this skylark
common on the prairies of the Saskatchewan,
and described the song as consisting
of a quick succession of notes, in a
descending scale, each note being lower
than the preceding. The bird then descends
to the ground with great rapidity,
almost like a stone, and somewhat in the
manner of a hawk sweeping on its prey.
He also saw these birds in northern Minnesota.</p>
<p>Some one says that the larks, those
creatures of &ldquo;light and air and motion,
whose nest is in the stubble and whose
tryst is in the cloud,&rdquo; are well-known as
the symbol of poets and victim of epicures,
and Burroughs, to whom they are
a symbol, says: &ldquo;Its type is the grass
where the bird makes its home, abounding,
multitudinous, the notes nearly all
alike and in the same key, but rapid,
swarming, prodigal, showering down as
thick and fast as drops of rain in a summer
shower.&rdquo; This of the skylark of
Europe. But he adds: &ldquo;On the Great
Plains of the West there is a bird whose
song resembles the lark&rsquo;s quite closely,
and it is said to be not at all inferior&mdash;the
Missouri Skylark, an excelsior songster,
which from far up in the transparent blue
rains down its notes for many minutes together.
It is no doubt destined to figure
in the future poetical literature of the
West.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet all that has been written of the
&ldquo;Star of music in a fiery cloud&rdquo; by Burroughs
and by Wadsworth, Shelley and
the rest, might properly have been indited
to the &ldquo;Musical Cherub&rdquo; of the Big
Muddy Valley, when, climbing, &ldquo;shrill
with ecstacy, the trembling air,&rdquo; he &ldquo;calls
up the tuneful nations,&rdquo; and the same
celestial pilgrim might have appeared to

<h2 id="c8">THE SHORT-BILLED MARSH WREN.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Cistothorus stellaris.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>Because of its shy and retiring disposition
and its apparent dislike to take wing
the Short-billed Marsh Wren is not very
often seen. It is usually found closely
associated with its first cousin, the long-billed
marsh wren, from which it is distinguished
by the markings on the back
and its short bill.</p>
<p>It inhabits the reeds and tall grass of
our marshes of the central states and
ranges as far north as Massachusetts
and Manitoba to as far west as Utah.</p>
<p>After spending the winter in the southern
states it reaches this locality about
the last of April or the first of May. The
marshes which it inhabits prevent close
observation. But the fact that nests have
been found with eggs in as early as the
last week of May indicates it arrives
about the last of April.</p>
<p>The nest is a loose, globular affair
situated in the top of a tussock of grass
or in rushes some twelve or eighteen
inches above the ground or water. It is
composed of coarse grass closely interwoven
with fine blades and fibers, making
a compact structure. The inner part
is lined with fine materials, such as soft
down, cat-tail blossoms, etc. At one side,
sometimes ingeniously hidden, is a small
round entrance. The nest resembles very
closely that of its first cousin in shape
and location, but can easily be recognized
by the eggs, which are pure white.</p>
<p>This little bird sometimes builds a
number of nests, but lays eggs in but
one. Whether it does this because it enjoys
the occupation, or for the purpose
of producing a &ldquo;blind,&rdquo; no one can say.
A number will nest in the same locality,
thus forming quite a colony.</p>
<p>Its song is quite different from that of
the long-billed. Mr. Gault says: &ldquo;In
the manner of delivery it forcibly reminds
one of the song of the dickcissel,
although, of course, it is not near as loud.
They are quite shy, but would allow one
to approach within forty or fifty feet of
them, when they would dart down into
the thick grass, from which it was almost
impossible to dislodge them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Washburn, in speaking of this bird
in the Red River valley, gives some interesting
accounts of its peculiarities. &ldquo;In
a large marsh * * * I found a colony
of these wrens, which by my presence
was thrown into most excitable activity.
They are at a disadvantage when on the
wing, these appendages seeming scarcely
able to support their obese bodies, for
they fly as though weighted like a bee
returning to a hive heavily laden. Instinctively
they fly toward the friendly
support of some tall weed where, as if
feeling more secure on their feet than
in the air, they resume their antics, hanging
their heads downward, twirling their
tails, jumping from one weed to another,
and each bird apparently communicating
its restlessness to its neighbor, until the
whole colony is in a state of ferment.
They do not alight gracefully like most
birds, but seem to tumble into the
weeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unless one is very cautious and persevering
he is not able to observe the activity
of these wee bits of bird life. He can
wade into their very midst and can hear
them chattering within a few feet of him
without seeing them or at the best getting
but a glimpse of one. But if he conceals
himself and remains quiet for perhaps
a half hour his efforts may be rewarded.</p>

<h2 id="c9">TWAIN LOVES OF JEREMIAH.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Do not leave me, I beg of you,&rdquo; implored
old Jeremiah, standing guard over
the opening in the fence. &ldquo;Believe me,
there are dangers outside of which you
know not. Snakes frequent the tangle
of these weeds and swine lie in wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay, if you are afraid. Stay, anyway,&rdquo;
she answered, curtly, and vaulting
over him, she went through the fence
and called her ten children from the
other side.</p>
<p>Jeremiah struck his white head in the
dust, praying her to return. He lunged
at the fence and fell back, baffled, his feet
beating the air. He floundered upright
and ran, entreating, along the fence, his
head thrusting between the interstices.
The obdurate fair one paid no heed. She
was talking baby talk to her followers.</p>
<p>Jeremiah, after exhausting every maneuvre
to get through, over or under the
fence, resigned himself to the inevitable
and began looking around for entertainment.
He is a great gander to keep
something going on. A trim black pullet
passed the orbit of his vision and he
sauntered up to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Miss Dominie. You
are looking charming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Dominie tossed her head. &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo;
she cackled, &ldquo;but I can only charm
you in the absence of Mrs. Cochin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I care for Mrs. Cochin?&rdquo;
protested Jeremiah, and he looked Miss
Dominie over with the eye of a connoisseur.
She was certainly well bred and
she carried herself erect. This was because
she had been raised a pet, but Jeremiah
ascribed it all to her aristocratic
lineage and thought complacently that if
any ill fate overtook Mrs. Cochin, Miss
Dominie would be a close second in his
affections. &ldquo;Mrs. Cochin is too old,&rdquo; he
added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is a good thing for you,&rdquo;
retorted Miss Dominie. &ldquo;She is too old
to be particular and she may tolerate you.
For myself, I draw the line at ganders.
Chickens are good enough for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk like a preacher,&rdquo; suavely
answered Jeremiah, &ldquo;and I agree with
you. They are good enough for me, too,&rdquo;
but Miss Dominie had darted around the
big coop and was lost to view. At that
moment Dollie came out of the house
carrying a bucket of water and went
from pan to trough, pouring the chickens
a fresh drink. With cries of delight,
Jeremiah fluttered in her rear, paddling
and throwing the water, making it an
undrinkable mixture for the chickens.
Suddenly his eyes dilated, his neck
straightened and stiffened, his wings
slightly lifted and his large feet passed
each other in rapid succession, fence-ward.
Dollie&rsquo;s father was coming from
the barn, walking stiffly, his arm pressed
against an aching back. His eye caught
Jeremiah&rsquo;s and the pursuit began. The
man forgot his lame back and plunged
forward, gathering small stones which
he aimed at Jeremiah. Round and round
the fence they went, the man throwing
stones and execrations; the gander gabbling,
ducking, dodging until he bethought
himself of the haven of gooseberry
bushes, scrambled under them and
into the orchard, through the hedge into
the open where, joy inexpressible, Mrs.
Cochin and her ten fluffs were tumbling
in the dog fennel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last I have found you, my beloved,&rdquo;
gasped Jeremiah, and he rounded
up the chicks and drove them into the
orchard. Mrs. Cochin followed, protesting.
She even flung herself at Jeremiah,
with many a cluck and scratch; but
Jeremiah had constituted himself head of
her household and, serene in the consciousness
of right, he took the family
through the orchard, under the gooseberry
bushes and back into the yard.</p>
<p>Jeremiah knew that a little of him went
a long way with Mrs. Cochin, yet he
never lost hope that his persistent devotion
would win her favor. He had been
a lone gander many years. There was
not another feather of his kind in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
poultry yard. It was sometimes marveled
that he did not take to the ducks, his
next of kin, fat and wabbly, with raucous
voices. It was so much easier to love
Mrs. Cochin, the perfection of grace and
beauty. She was large and stately. She
wore always a buff robe that flashed in
the sun like burnished gold. Poor Jeremiah
fell easily a prey to her unconscious
wiles and consecrated himself, body and
soul, to her personal attendance and protection.</p>
<p>Jeremiah&rsquo;s first concern, again inside
the yard, was to reconnoitre for his
friend, the enemy. He was nowhere in
sight and Jeremiah turned pleadingly to
Mrs. Cochin. &ldquo;Let us make up,&rdquo; he
urged. &ldquo;Your coldness is killing me.
I honestly think I have not long to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diet yourself,&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Cochin,
her feminine intuitions connecting
cause and effect. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t be a goose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Cochin went scratching in a
flower bed. Ignored, he followed at a
respectful distance, hissing at the pup
who ambled near, striking a cat whose
lithe body was poised for a spring at one
of the chickens, and frightening away a
brood of ducklings. All afternoon the
faithful sentinel executed his self-imposed
duty, and finally followed his
charmer across the yard to the old
workshop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not go in there,&rdquo; he cried, sharply.</p>
<p>For answer Mrs. Cochin tripped over
the threshold, clucking to her chicks.
She flew upon the work bench, thence to
a rafter and settled herself as if for the
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think I am going to do
with these chickens?&rdquo; grumbled Jeremiah,
trying to arouse her maternal solicitude.
&ldquo;Let the rats catch them, I don&rsquo;t
care. They are not my chickens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Cochin looked down. She
drooped a wing and shut an eye. Her
attitude indicated that she would take
proper care of her offspring as soon as
their company had taken his welcome
leave.</p>
<p>Again Jeremiah went through the
scene at the fence. He gabbled his vain
protestations. He groveled in the dust.
He flung his unwieldly weight against
the work bench and made many futile
attempts to rise to Mrs. Cochin&rsquo;s superior
elevation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You distract, humiliate me,&rdquo; he
hissed. &ldquo;Your heart is no larger than
your head. You may stay there. I
wash my feet of you,&rdquo; and suiting the
action of the word, he waddled into the
water trough and fluttered there.</p>
<p>The black pullet drew near. She was
really a comely creature, Jeremiah
thought, and he stopped fluttering. If it
were not for the fatal glitter of Mrs.
Cochin&rsquo;s blonde beauty, he might learn
to care for demure Miss Dominie. He
didn&rsquo;t know but he could, anyway, and
gracefully curving his kingly neck he
approached her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Miss Dominie. You
are looking very charming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Dominie pretended not to hear.
She was too young to be entirely unmoved
by his apparent admiration and
she felt vaguely sorry for him; but the
sun was very low and the sand man
had passed her twice. She was looking
for a spring bed on one of the low limbs
of the cottonwood tree. Jeremiah followed
her, babbling the story of his
wretched loneliness, until they unwittingly
crossed the path of his enemy, the
man. Jeremiah&rsquo;s voice sank to a whisper
and he hid behind a tree. Jeremiah
is a goose about a good many things, but
he knows when to lay dead.</p>
<p>The black pullet brushed against him
and his heart warmed&mdash;but she was only
enflight to the limb overhead. She
leaned forward and spoke to him, drowsily:
&ldquo;I am sorry, Jeremiah. It is the
old story and I can only advise you to get
used to it. Don&rsquo;t you give up. Remember,
you can have anything in this world
you want if you keep after it until you
get it; that is one of the fixed laws of
the universe. I think you will find Mrs.
Cochin in the end coop now. I saw Dollie
gathering the chickens into her apron
and carrying Mrs. Cochin by the wing.
It might be well to excite her jealousy.
You may say to her that I have at last
consented to be yours. Tell her that you
have come to bid her a final farewell.
Give her back that scar she made on your
neck and assure her that I am a jealous
god and object to your even passing the
time of day with her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>Jeremiah hastened to the end coop.
Between the slats he recognized the profile
of his beloved, hovering her fluffs.
He tried to get his head inside, but the
openings were too small and he could get
in only as far as his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come to say farewell,&rdquo; he
breathed, hoarsely. &ldquo;I have found one
younger and fairer than you.&rdquo; His soul
revolted when he said &ldquo;fairer,&rdquo; for Jeremiah
hates a lie, and even if Miss Dominie
be a diamond it cannot be denied she
is of the charcoal variety. &ldquo;I may see
you sometimes,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;for I do
not expect to leave the farm, and I wish
you to know that the bright particular
star of my life has blazed out and henceforth
I am hers alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeremiah gushed on, rapturing over
his new attraction until he half convinced
himself; gushed on, rapturing,
until Mrs. Cochin lifted her head and
struck him with her bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make me very tired,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;If you have any respect for your lady
love, keep your mouth shut about her.
Don&rsquo;t let everybody know you are a
goose. Of course, you would be just as
big a goose if you kept your mouth shut,
but everybody wouldn&rsquo;t know it. Even
a gander owes that much to himself:
not to let it get out how big a goose he
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying this, she tucked her head and
sang a soft lullaby to her fluffs, and their
faint, sweet &ldquo;peep, peep,&rdquo; lost in a low
croon of content, sounded to forlorn
Jeremiah like music behind the locked
gates of paradise.</p>
<p>Sadly he clambered upon the back of
an old wagon seat, half way between the
end coop and the black pullet; and the
friendly dark came down; and old Jeremiah
lost the ache of self in the oblivion
of sleep.</p>

<h2 id="c11">THE ORCHARD ORIOLE.</h2>
<p>The first of May finds the trees and
shrubs well clothed in tender green, the
air laden with the perfume of many blossoms,
and bird life abounding. The
number has been rapidly increasing since
the coming of the meadow lark and robin
that proclaim the approach of the moving
host. Since their songs of joyous
anticipation first were heard reverberating
through field and orchard, almost every
day has brought some new arrival, till
now the air is alive with feathered creatures
and hilarious song is rife. With
ever varying motions they search for
food and sport among the tree branches,
or course through the vault of heaven.
Nidification is now in progress in various
stages of advancement, according to the
species of bird.</p>
<p>But many of our summer visitors are
still absent, yet just now is the season
that one of the most interesting should
make his appearance and join in the general
jubilee. This is the Orchard Oriole,
and he is among the gayest of the gay
of all this merry throng.</p>
<p>Being a soft-billed bird, or insect eater,
he defers his migration until insects have
become plentiful. He is remarkably uniform
in migration. Wintering south of
the United States, he enters our borders
about the last of March and with unusual
regularity steadily makes his way onward
till he reaches the northern limit
of his range the latter part of May.</p>
<p>In the southern states arid southern
portion of the middle states east of the
Rocky mountains this Oriole is one of the
most abundant and familiar songsters
that frequent the orchards and gardens.</p>
<p>He is a very conspicuous bird in both
plumage and song. Although not quite
so brilliantly attired as his cousin Baltimore,
his coat of chestnut and black is
very noticeable. His song is loud and
gushing and resembles that of the rose-breasted
grosbeak enough for the superficial
observer to confound the two, but
to the trained ear there is a decided difference.
The notes, though uttered with
force and rapidity, are varied, clear and
sweet. His sojourn with us is short,
but while here his rapturous refrain is
heard almost incessantly. This sprightly
bird is seldom, if ever, inactive, but with
ever-moving pinion he flits from branch
to branch, from tree to tree, and even
when giving forth his gushing melody he
quivers and sways.</p>
<p>Orchard Orioles are masters in the art
of nest-building. The nest, a beautiful
basket-like structure about three inches
across and the same in length, is attached
to half-upright or horizontal branches.
Usually it is half pensile, though some
are wholly pendent. It is always made
of blades of long, slender grasses woven
together in a most wonderful manner
and lined with plant fiber and feathers.
As the grass is invariably used while
fresh and green, the nest is of a more or
less green hue at all times, and consequently
difficult to detect among the
thick foliage. The four or five bluish-white
eggs are spotted with a purplish
color. At first the nestlings are fed on
tiny insects and later on beetles and
grasshoppers. The number of noxious
insects a pair of these birds will destroy
in a season is almost incredible.</p>

<h2 id="c12">THE PRAIRIE WARBLER.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Dendroica discolor.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>This beautiful little Warbler cannot
fail to awaken an interest in bird life in
the mind of any person whose privilege
it is to observe it in its chosen haunts.
These are the shrubby pasture lands and
the open woods of the eastern United
States. It is more common in barren,
sandy places of the Atlantic coast, where
it seems to find an insect food suited to
its taste. It not infrequently visits orchards,
when in bloom, especially those
in retired localities. Wilson, who wrote
enthusiastically of the Prairie Warbler,
says: &ldquo;They seem to prefer open plains
and thinly-wooded tracts, and have this
singularity in their manners, that they
are not easily alarmed, and search among
the leaves the most leisurely of any of
the tribe I have yet met with, seeming
to examine every blade of grass and
every leaf, uttering at short intervals a
feeble chirr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Coues was also an ardent admirer
of this little bird and during his college
days frequently hunted and studied its
habits. He found the &ldquo;inflection of the
Prairie Warbler&rsquo;s notes a much more
agreeable theme than that of a Greek
verb,&rdquo; and possibly quite as profitable.
He says: &ldquo;There was a little glade just
by the college, a sloping sandy field run
waste with scattered cedars, where we
could be sure of finding the Warblers
any day, from the twentieth of April,
for two or three weeks. Ten to one we
would not see the little creatures at
first. But presently, from the nearest
juniper, would come the well known
sounds. A curious song, if song it can
be called&mdash;as much like a mouse complaining
of the toothache as anything
else I can liken it to&mdash;it is simply indescribable.
Then perhaps the quaint
performer would dart out into the air,
turn a somersault after a passing midge,
get right side up and into the shrubbery
again in an instant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flight of the Prairie Warbler is
neither strong nor protracted. Yet it is
one of the most expert fly catchers
among the Warblers. It is not a social
bird and it is very seldom that more than
two or three are seen together. A peculiar
characteristic of this Warbler is
that it does not try to lead an intruder
away from the vicinity of its nest. Mr.
Nuttall speaks of removing two eggs
from a nest and replacing them in a
short time. Each time he removed the
eggs the female bird returned to the
nest.</p>
<p>The Prairie Warbler is prettily colored.
The back is marked with reddish-brown
spots on an olive-green ground.
Beneath the eye of the male there is a
streak of black which is absent in the
female. The throat and under parts are
a rich yellow color, with small spots of
black on the sides of the neck. The female
is duller in color.</p>
<p>The nest is nearly always placed in
the fork of a branch of either a tree or
shrub and never far from the ground.
A wild rose bush is sometimes selected.
Mr. Welch describes one that he found
in such a place. It was mainly constructed
of &ldquo;the soft inner bark of small
shrubs mingled with dry rose leaves, bits
of wood, woody fibers, decayed stems of
plants, spiders&rsquo; webs, etc.&rdquo; These were
elaborately woven together and bound by
&ldquo;cotton-like fibers of a vegetable origin.&rdquo;
The nest had a lining of fine fibers and
horse hair. He also calls attention to
the upper rim of the nest, it &ldquo;being a
strongly interlaced weaving of vegetable
roots and strips of bark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Nuttall describes the nest as not
unlike that of a summer yellow-bird. He
speaks of one that he examined as &ldquo;being
fixed in a trifid branch and formed of
strips of inner red cedar bark and asclepias
(milkweed) fibers, also with some
caterpillar silk, and thickly lined with
cud-weed down and slender tops of the
bent grass (Agrostis.)&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>It is difficult to understand why this
bird should be called the Prairie Warbler,
unless it is in order to distinguish
it from those species that frequent less
open places. A much more appropriate
name is the Chestnut-backed Yellow
Warbler. Though it is found in open
places, this little bird would easily elude
observation were it not for its peculiar
notes, which Mr. Chapman describes as
&ldquo;a series of six or seven quickly repeated
zees, the next to the last one the highest.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c13">APRIL BIRDS AND FLOWERS OF THE MISSISSIPPI GULF COAST.</h2>
<p>Fickle April, with its sullen showers
and teasing, wayward moods, its alternate
days of warm sunshine and chilling
rain, still leaves us who live north of the
fortieth parallel in doubt whether summer
really intends to come or not. Not
so on the gulf coast; langorous breezes
incline one to take life easy, the sun
high overhead has the true June fervor,
and, if further evidence is needed to convince
us, ripening strawberries and
blooming roses tell us that summer is
here. Gardens filled with huge, flaming
amaryllis, fragrant calycanthus and
a thousand and one shrubs strange to the
northern eye, greet us in every yard. In
front of the houses and along the streets,
their purple fragrance welcoming every
newcomer, stand the China trees, the
haunt of busy bees and their indefatigable
pursuer the kingbird, or bee martin.</p>
<p>In the lowlands a short distance back
from the beach, the azaleas (Azalea nudiflora)
are just dropping the last of their
pink bloom, a bouquet thrown at the feet
of all-conquering summer. Here and
there in these jungles of yupon, bay, buttonwood,
etc., appears a shrub clad in a
filmy white mist. If this be the season
for weddings, it must be that this is the
bride that greets our eyes. A delicately
beautiful bride she is, with arms that
toss in the slightest breeze and now and
then coyly shove aside the cloudy veil to
take a farewell glimpse at the world she
leaves.</p>
<p>The natives do not take this view of
this shrub (Chionanthus virginicus).
They have dubbed it &ldquo;grand-daddy-gray-beard.&rdquo;
Usually popular names have
much to justify them, but in the instance
just mentioned, and that of the brilliant
red flower which gazes at us from the
underbrush, they are suggestive of African
superstition rather than Saxon sentiment.
The melancholy local fancy sees
in these flaming orbs only the power of
evil, hence the name &ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s eye.&rdquo; If
I could be assured that the devil&rsquo;s eye is
really as beautiful and kind in its expression
as its floral representative I
would be willing, like Emerson, to call
its possessor &ldquo;the dear old devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us go back to the beach and stroll
along the shell road, which parallels the
shore all the way from Gulfport to Biloxi.
Perhaps the glare of the white
road is not pleasant to the eyes, but the
deep green of live oak and long leafed
pine is restful, the mingled fragrance of
the salt breeze of the gulf, the resiny
odor of the pine and the blossoming wisteria
charm the senses and lull us into
rapturous content. Only a few of the
trees and shrubs which border the highway
are of the kinds familiar to observers
in Ohio and Illinois. Now and then
a water oak or a sweet gum appears;
but otherwise in the cypress, pine or
live oak of the larger growth, or in the
palmetto, Spanish dagger and rattan
vine of the undergrowth, the eye looks
in vain for old acquaintances.</p>
<p>The live oak certainly has individuality.
<span class="pb" id="Page_215">215</span>
Shorter and more spreading in
its habit of growth than most of its kind,
its limbs are gnarled and knotty, strong
and muscular with its wrestling with
the hurricanes that sweep the bosom of
the gulf. It loves the white sand just a
few feet above high tide, where it stands
as a protector for the weaker growth between
the tossing waters and the great
pine forest. As is the case with human
beings, this vigorous conflict with its
surroundings does it good; for no place
in the South that I have been have I
found the live oaks as plentiful or as
vigorous as on this strip of barren sand.</p>
<p>The birds know a good thing when
they see it; hence they are well represented
here at this season of the year.
Our old acquaintance of the Maumee
Valley, the Maryland yellow throat,
with his cunning black mask and his
cheerful if not wholly musical &ldquo;Wichety,
wichety, wichety,&rdquo; greets us from a
perch on a rattan vine, but on our nearer
approach dives down into the palmettos,
where only the noise made by his tiny
feet indicates his whereabouts. Two
other warblers, the hooded and the redstart,
a little belated, perhaps, have
stopped here on their way north to the
old nesting grounds on the Kankakee
and the Hudson. The most numerous as
well as the most conspicuous element of
the bird population is the summer tanager,
whose intensely scarlet coat adds a
touch of vivid color very grateful to the
eye. Nearly every oak contains one of
these redcoats, whistling a solo for our
benefit or discussing the details of housekeeping
with his more sober coated little
wife.</p>
<p>Almost as numerous as the tanagers,
and even more interesting, are the orchard
orioles. Their song has more of
the fire and ring of true music, a compensation
probably for the comparative
dullness of their garb. In nest building
the orchard oriole is an artist. I remember
one day finding in a small water oak
a nest so carefully woven out of excelsior
as to make me think the bird could
knit if he would only turn his talent in
that direction. Where twine and excelsior
are not easily obtained, no doubt
they utilize the long streamers of Spanish
moss which hang from half the trees
in the gulf country.</p>
<p>Flying about in the gardens, as tame
as robins on northern lawns, or sharing
the live oaks with the tanagers and orioles,
are a multitude of mocking birds.
There must be something in Maurice
Thompson&rsquo;s suggestion in &ldquo;By Ways
and Bird Notes&rdquo; that along this coast
the mocking birds find those berries and
seeds best adapted to develop a high degree
of musical ability and artistic expression,
for these birds certainly surpass
their brethren found a few hundred
miles to the north.</p>
<p>Besides these land birds there are a
multitude of sea birds more conspicuous
on account of noise and numbers than
bright coloring or attractive ways. The
herring gull is very plentiful on this
coast, wherever sand flats and shallow
water offer attractive feeding grounds.
It is a pleasant sight to see a dozen of
these pearl gray creatures turning and
wheeling, as free and easy as the wind.
Just in shore from where the gulls are
flying are some fish crows, a thoughtless,
noisy set, contented to feast on the crabs
and stray minnows which have eluded
the watchful gulls. At the edge of the
water, just where the wavelets of the
receding tide curl and swish before turning
back to join their fellows, a couple
of sandpipers are running a race, now
and then stopping to pick up some tidbit
left by the water. A shadow flits along
the sand. We look up. A great fish
hawk or osprey soars seaward. He sails
past the noisy crows, past the graceful
gulls and steers for Ship Island, that
line of darker haze where sky and ocean
meet. Truly, April is the season to visit
this coast.</p>

<h2 id="c14">BIRTH STONES.</h2>
<p>From the earliest times and among all
peoples there seem to have been sentiments
and superstitions connected with
gems. The ancient use of gems is
proved by their being found in the
oldest tombs of Egypt and by their mention
in the earliest books of the Bible,
and no less ancient seem to be the mystic
properties and powers ascribed to them.</p>
<p>Not only was the power of driving
away evil spirits and producing all sorts
of &ldquo;luck&rdquo; long attributed to them, but
as late as the beginning of the eighteenth
century reputable physicians were accustomed
to mix fragments of them in their
medicines and to use them as charms.
The study of the uses of gems in this
way forms a subject of much interest,
but we may confine ourselves here simply
to the custom which made a particular
gem appropriate to a corresponding
month of the year.</p>
<p>The first arrangement of gems into a
group of twelve of which we have any
record is that in the Book of Exodus.
Here in the twenty-eighth chapter, verses
17-19, are prescribed in order, twelve
precious stones, which shall be set in
the breastplate of the High Priest. The
list is repeated in the thirty-ninth chapter
of the same book, verses 10-12. In the
context it is prescribed that the stones
shall be set in four rows and that upon
them shall be engraved the names of the
Children of Israel, one for each stone.
As to the particular stones as they are
known to the modern world, which are
indicated by the Hebrew words, authorities
differ, but in the authorized version
of the Bible they are given as follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sardius, topaz, carbuncle,</p>
<p class="t0">Emerald, sapphire, diamond,</p>
<p class="t0">Ligure, agate, amethyst,</p>
<p class="t0">Beryl, onyx, jasper.</p>
</div>
<p>It is not probable, however, that these
names indicate in each case the corresponding
stones of modern usage. Thus
it is quite unlikely that the Hebrews
could have engraved a name upon the
diamond even if they could have obtained
one of sufficient size. Again, the words
emerald and carbuncle are undoubtedly
interchanged in the above list and the
ancient topaz is known to have been
the modern chrysolite. In the revised
version the word jacinth is substituted
for ligure and amber is given as a marginal
rendering for the same. There are
also given marginal renderings for others
of the gems, as follows: ruby for sardius,
emerald for carbuncle, carbuncle for emerald,
sardonyx for diamond, chalcedony
for beryl, and beryl for onyx. The modern
equivalents of the terms recognized
by secret orders which use them in symbolism
are:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Carnelian, chrysolite, emerald,</p>
<p class="t0">Ruby, lapis-lazuli, onyx,</p>
<p class="t0">Sapphire, agate, amethyst,</p>
<p class="t0">Topaz, beryl, jasper.</p>
</div>
<p>Two lists of precious stones quite
similar to those of the Book of Exodus
are given in other places in the Bible, one
in Ezekiel 28:13, where &ldquo;every precious
stone&rdquo; is said to have been the covering
of the King of Tyre, and again in Revelation
21:19-20, where twelve different
precious stones are mentioned as garnishing
the foundations of the wall of the
Holy City. The names and order of these
in Ezekiel are, in the authorized version,
as follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sardius, topaz, diamond,</p>
<p class="t0">Beryl, onyx, jasper,</p>
<p class="t0">Sapphire, emerald, carbuncle.</p>
</div>
<p>To these the Septuagint adds the following:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Chrysolite, ligure, agate.</p>
</div>
<p>The revised version gives marginally,
ruby for sardius, carbuncle for emerald,
and emerald for carbuncle. In Revelation
the list as given in the authorized
version reads as follows&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jasper, sapphire, chalcedony,</p>
<p class="t0">Emerald, sardonyx, sardius,</p>
<p class="t0">Chrysolite, beryl, topaz,</p>
<p class="t0">Chrysoprase, jacinth, amethyst.</p>
</div>
<p>The marginal renderings give lapis-lazuli
for sapphire and sapphire for jacinth.</p>

<p>Though in each of these lists only
twelve precious stones are mentioned,
there is nothing to indicate that their
use was in any way connected with the
months of the year. Just when it became
the custom to designate each month by a
particular gem or how the custom originated
is impossible to determine. The
custom seems to have sprung up in modern
Europe some time during the fifteenth
or sixteenth century. Whether it
originated in the twelve gems of Aaron&rsquo;s
breastplate as many believe, or was introduced
by astrologers from the Arabians
as others think, is not yet known.</p>
<p>The modern practice of considering
the stone of each month especially appropriate
to persons born in that month
is probably still more recent in its origin.
In former times gems could be possessed
only by rulers or the very wealthy, so
that their general use in the above manner
was not possible. But now that
nearly every one can own a gem of some
kind the possession of &ldquo;birth stones&rdquo; and
the attachment of special sentiments to
them has become common. The custom
is a pretty one, and is to be commended,
for the stones are imperishable and the
sentiments ascribed to them represent the
accumulated traditions of many ages,
races and peoples.</p>
<p>As to the particular stone which is to
be considered appropriate to each month
usages differ. Such differences have
doubtless arisen from the desire to introduce
gems which were formerly little
known or unattainable on account of
their cost, as substitutes for stones formerly
prized but now held of little value.
Thus the precious opal now much admired
was hardly known in former times.
By some it is now used as the birth stone
of the month of October, while others
retain the beryl. The diamond has been introduced
in modern practice in quite a
similar way. The carnelian and chrysolite
by some still used for the months of August
and September are stones held of
little worth at present, and hence others
are usually substituted. The particular
order and kind of stones adopted in the
accompanying plate is given in accordance
with some verses quoted in a
pamphlet first published by Tiffany &amp;
Company, of New York, in 1870. The
author of the verses is not known, nor is
it known by just what authority these
gems were chosen. The choice, however,
seems as satisfactory as could be made.
Some of the verses have been quoted in
previous numbers of this magazine, but
they may here be given entire:</p>

<h2 id="c15">APPLE BLOSSOMS AND THE WARBLERS.</h2>
<p>It was a cold, rainy day toward the
last of May. The apple trees were a
mass of pink and white, but the fast
gathering petals on the green carpet told
the story; not for long would be wafted
in through each window a whiff of such
perfume as only Dame Nature, May and
Company can distill. Unfortunately, I
was in no mood to appreciate the beauties
of a spring rain, for it was a very evident
fact that the bad weather would
prevent our anticipated bird walk. This
fact I was bewailing, looking forlornly
from the window out into the dripping
world, when lo, I found that, contrary
to expectations, the mountain does on
occasion appear unto Mahomet!</p>
<p>On the lawn north of our house are
nearly a dozen apple trees, two of which
have branches overhanging the roof. I
noticed that the foliage was in livelier
motion than is usually caused by an easy
shower, and on closer examination discovered
that the trees were fairly alive
with flitting forms, birds&mdash;warblers in
all their glory. This was long before
noon, and it was but the beginning of a
state bordering on ecstasy for me which
ended only when darkness fell, as it
gave me the opportunity for making the
acquaintance of a family, straggling
members of which, only, I had met since
my interest in feathered friends awakened.</p>
<p>To my delight I immediately brought
within range of my glass the little fellow
which I had seen the year before in
the same tree, and had described in my
note-book as &ldquo;wearing a sun burst of
black on a yellow vest.&rdquo; On this occasion
he was much in evidence, and the
details of his handsome coat could be
plainly detected. He is mostly black, and
you may distinguish him by the broad
white patch on his wings and the yellow
breast which is decorated by a black pendant
necklace. He is the magnolia warbler.</p>
<p>The chestnut-sided was well represented
in the flock, and was an old friend.
With us here in New Hampshire, he
stays through the summer, but it is only
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
at this season that we are apt to meet
him. One recognizes him by his clear
greenish-yellow crown and by the clearly
defined chestnut streak on either side of
his white vest.</p>
<p>Of course the Lord of the Manor is
the Blackburnian warbler. To my great
delight, he brought his wonderful flaming
breast within four feet of me as I
sat in one of the upper windows, watching
him explore the branches. Mark
him well. His upper parts are black,
while his crown, throat and breast are
flaming orange. He, too, wears a white
vest, marked at the sides with black. So
beautiful is he that words fail to describe
him, while to see him flitting about
among the apple blossoms was indeed
&ldquo;a picture no artist could paint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next on my list was a discovery,
and one over which I was jubilant. He
was an elusive little fellow, and led me
out into the rain and kept me standing
there with the drops trickling down my
face as I searched the branches for him.
He was the daintiest sprite imaginable,
whose blue-gray coat was like satin and
whose white breast shading from a yellow
throat could not make him conspicuous.
It was only when I discovered that
his back was a beautiful shade of bronzy-greenish-yellow
that I knew he was the
parula warbler, the blue yellow back.
Then I went to the authorities to learn
more about my stranger. Then I read
that he wears another distinguishing
mark, a brown streak across the throat.
Back to the garden I went. Eureka! he
satisfied all conditions, and was named!
During this shower of warblers the parula
was the most numerous species, excepting,
perhaps, the chestnut sided.</p>
<p>A redstart came in for its share of admiration,
and his beauty deserved it, but
his evident appreciation of his own
charms as he dashed here and there,
opening and closing his fan-like tail,
rather detracted from his character as he
was viewed alongside his beautiful companions,
who, to say the least, are modestly
unaware of their charms.</p>
<p>Later, another discovery was made,
and one that puzzled us for some time.
At the first glimpse of him we said,
&ldquo;Chickadee, of course,&rdquo; for we saw his
black cap and his general black and
white aspect. Then as he flew to a tree
near the window, and we marked every
point possible, we found that his back
was closely striped with black and white,
that his breast and belly were white, and
that his wings were tinged with olive
and had two white bars. We could not
name him, and to my amazement Miss
Wilcox did not have such a one in her
&ldquo;Common Land Birds of New England.&rdquo;
so not until I went to &ldquo;Birdcraft&rdquo; did I
learn that my visitor was the black poll
warbler. He was always intent upon his
own affairs, seemed rather superior to
the common herd, and was the last one
of the visitation to leave me.</p>
<p>The Maryland yellow throat was
here, too, away from his native alders,
but seemingly not one bit confused
to find himself an orchard bird. Perhaps
he was only &ldquo;going a piece&rdquo;
with his relatives and connections as
they journeyed north. He is a beauty,
and you may hear him in any alder
swamp calling &ldquo;witchy-titchy, witchy-titchy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I searched and searched for the black
and white creeper whom we often see,
but evidently he did not like a mixed
crowd, for I did not discover him until
several days later, when the main flock
had passed on. The rest, however, were
on every side, and so tame and confiding
were they that a raised sash, or an ecstatic
shout to a watcher at another window
did not appear to disturb them in the
least.</p>
<p>They were voiceless, though, intent
upon nothing but dinner, except the redstart,
who seemed to take settlement life
as somewhat of a joke and, as he
careered about, occasionally called to
&ldquo;sweet, sweeter, sweet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the day passed, a continual surprise
party, and the next day came, and still
the flock lingered. But when the rain
ceased, and the sun reappeared, they
lifted their wings and hastened to pastures
new, leaving only a straggler here
and there. Will a spring rain this year
find them passing over my apple trees?
So may it be.</p>

<br />(Equus caballus.)
<br /><span class="small">ADAPTED FROM A PAINTING.</span></p></div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<h2 id="c17">THE HORSE.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Equus caballus.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>There are many objects which are so
commonly seen that we deceive ourselves
by thinking we know much about
them, and yet should we make a special
study of these same objects, often we
would find ourselves woefully ignorant in
regard to some of their most distinguishing
characteristics.</p>
<p>Every day of our lives we see Horses.
These frequently move with exquisite
grace and beauty, stepping daintily and
proudly as if hardly deigning to remain
on earth, but seeming just ready to rise
and fly as did the fabled winged horse
Pegasus. With rapidly moving feet</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The landscape speeds far away behind</p>
<p class="t0">Like an ocean driven before the wind,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>and we look on only to admire and wonder.
And yet how comparatively few of
those who watch the fascinating motion
of a rapidly moving Horse know that the
beautiful animal is running on only one
toe, for that indeed is all it possesses for
each foot. The foot proper extends as
high as the apparent knee. This is in
reality the wrist or ankle, and the apparent
foot is but a finger or toe corresponding
to the middle finger and middle toe
of the hand and foot of man. The hoof
may be likened to the finger nail. In
fact, it is a great, thick, enlarged nail,
finishing and protecting the toe above.</p>
<p>The Horse belongs to a great division,
known as the odd-toed animals. There
are about twenty-five species of these
animals now existing and they are divided
into four families, the one-toed
Horses, the tapirs with four toes in front
and three behind; the rhinoceroses with
three toes, and the cony family with four
toes on their fore feet and three on the
hinderfeet. These four families are
very different in their ways of living and
are so unlike that one would not expect
to find them relatives.</p>
<p>The native country of the Horse seems
to be nearly the entire northern hemisphere,
for fossil remains are found
throughout this region, but in America
the Horse (never found south of Alaska)
became extinct, and for a time there were
no Horses on the western continent. After
the discovery of America, Horses were
imported into the country and in time
some escaped from their owners and
formed herds which have multiplied until
there are a great many wild Horses now
roaming over the new world.</p>
<p>In Europe wild Horses also became extinct,
but at a comparatively recent date;
but in Asia and Africa there seems to be
no time when the wild Horses have not
been roaming over the plains and tablelands,
as free as the wind.</p>
<p>On the steppes of southeastern Europe
there are great herds of peculiar Horses,
called tarpans. These are indeed freedom-loving
animals and one can but feel
a certain sympathy with their unwillingness
to be tamed. They are a rather
small Horse with thin, strong legs, a
rather long, thin neck and a comparatively
thick, blunt-muzzled head. They
have small, brilliant, wicked eyes; the
hair is thick and short in summer and inclined
to curl; in winter it is longer and
coarser and on the chin becomes almost
like a beard.</p>
<p>Not content to roam in freedom by
themselves, they will, if possible, entice
domesticated Horses to join their number.
On this account they are persistently
hunted, as they do considerable
damage.</p>
<p>The great herds are divided into families,
each family led by a stallion who is
sole ruler, taking the best of care of his
subjects, but permitting no irregularity.
These herds wander from place to place,
usually running against the wind, and
their keen sense of hearing warns them
of approaching danger. The stallions
do not fear beasts of prey and will sally
forth against wolves and beat them down
with their fore-hoofs.</p>
<p>The earliest representations of Horses
and the fossil remains of the prehistoric
animals show them to be of rather small
size and not unlike the tarpans, suggesting
the idea to some minds that the tarpans
<span class="pb" id="Page_226">226</span>
were the ancestors of the modern
domesticated breeds, but the facility with
which the Horse will resume its wild
state makes opinions of little value.</p>
<p>The South American wild Horses,
called &ldquo;the wild Horse of the Pampas,&rdquo;
were all descended from a few domesticated
Horses left in the town of Buenos
Ayres, which was abandoned some time
after the year 1535. These Horses are
called cimarrones. They roam in immense
herds and are considered a nuisance,
as they consume good pasturage
and also lead away the domestic Horses.
The mustangs of Paraguay, although
domestic Horses, vary little from the
conditions of the wild Horses of the
pampas, as they are much neglected, live
out of doors all the year around and
really degenerate for want of care.</p>
<p>A. von Humboldt gives an interesting
description of the life of the Horse in the
Llanos, the great grassy plains lying further
to the north. When the never-clouded
sun turns the grass to dust, the
Horses and cattle roam about, pressed by
hunger and thirst, and by inflating their
nostrils endeavor to discover by the
damper air currents localities where the
water has not yet evaporated.</p>
<p>The Mules, using more intelligence,
beat with their fore-feet the prickly exterior
of the melon cactus and quench
their thirst with the watery pulp.</p>
<p>When finally the rainy season begins,
the Horses still meet with danger and
trouble, as the swelling rivers surround
their grazing places and the colts are
frequently drowned. Jaguars often lurk
in the tall grass and crocodiles are a constant
menace. Even among the fish there
are dangerous enemies. The electric eels
&ldquo;can kill the largest animals by means of
their powerful discharges if their efforts
are concentrated upon certain portions of
the body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Horses are often their own enemies.
Becoming frantic with terror, in
a frenzy of fright, they destroy themselves
by dashing against rocks or rushing
over precipices.</p>
<p>There is much that is interesting in regard
to the half-wild Horses of North
America. These are all descendants of
imported varieties, and while owned by
the various ranchmen, they have the freedom
of the range or prairie. Ofter they
are seen by their owners only at the annual
&ldquo;round-up,&rdquo; when they are driven
into the &ldquo;corrals&rdquo; in order that the colts
may be marked with the brand of the
owner.</p>
<p>One can spend much time studying the
instructive facts in regard to the interesting
wild and half-wild Horses of the
globe, and still feel that much remains
unlearned. Yet all will admit that the
most beautiful and perfect types of
Horses are those bred under the direct
supervision of man.</p>
<p>Of those which attain the greatest
speed, most prominent are the English
thoroughbred, the American race horse,
and the Trakehnen Horse, the finest
Horse of German breed.</p>
<p>These are all the result of many years
of careful selection, each finding among
its ancestors the noted Arab steeds,
&ldquo;praised as the noblest animal of creation
by the naturalist, the expert and the
poet.&rdquo; The Horses of the Levant and
the Barbary have also aided to render the
English thoroughbred the greatest race
horse of the old world. The American
trotters have not been behind, for as far
back as 1889 the maximum recorded
pace was one mile in two minutes and
three and three-fourths seconds.</p>
<p>For the practical uses of life there
seem to be as many breeds of Horses as
are necessary to meet the varying requirements
of an industrial civilization.
We find all kinds and sizes, from the
heavy and powerful Percheron or
Clydesdale cart Horse, standing sometimes
over six feet in height, to the
smallest Shetland pony which may be
even less than three feet at the withers,
and we find Horses of various colors, of
various lengths of mane and tail, and
of varying degrees of intelligence.</p>
<p>While all Horses are not well treated,
yet no animal is so respected and loved by
man and no other animal has become so
close a companion. While many nations
as a whole have loved and cherished their
Horses, the Arab steeds have been most
appreciated and have entered closest into
the daily life and thought of their masters.
Only when it has attained its seventh
year do they consider the education
of the Horse complete and meanwhile it
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">227</span>
has been the constant companion and
friend of its master.</p>
<p>In the extravagant and poetical language
of the East, one Arab thus speaks
of his beloved Horse: &ldquo;Do not tell me
that this animal is my horse, say that he
is my son. It runs more quickly than
the wind of a storm, more swiftly than
the glance that sweeps the plains. It is
pure as gold. Its eye is clear and so keen
that it sees a hair in the dark. It overtakes
the gazelle in its course. To the
eagle it says: I hurry on like you. When
it hears the shouts of girls it neighs with
joy, and the whistling of bullets rejoices
its heart. From the hands of women it
begs for alms; the enemy it beats in the
face with its hoofs. When it can run to
its heart&rsquo;s desire, it weeps tears. It recks
not whether the sky be clear or the blasts
of the desert obscure the light of the sun
with dust; for it is a noble steed and despises
the rage of the storm. There is
no other in this world that could vie with
it. Swift as a swallow, it courses on;
so light is its weight that it could dance
on the breast of your beloved and not
annoy her. It understands all like a son
of Adam, and all it lacks is speech.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c19">THE VERBENAS.</h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Hallowed be thou, Vervain,</p>
<p class="t">As thou growest on the ground,</p>
<p class="t0">For in the Mount of Calvary</p>
<p class="t">There thou wast first found.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The name Verbena in the language
of flowers signifies enchantment. It is
an ancient Latin name for a common
European Vervain. As a classic name,
however, the name Verbena was applied
to any branch that was used in the
celebration of religious rites. Though
the Vervain of our illustration belongs
to this genus it is not the same plant
that was held in high esteem and as a
sacred herb by the Greeks and Romans,
yet it is generally believed that the
&ldquo;herba sacra&rdquo; of these ancient peoples
was a Vervain. And even to-day the
name &ldquo;Herb of Grace&rdquo; is sometimes applied
to the common wayside flower
which we illustrate.</p>
<p>Virgil and other classic poets speak of
the Verbena as used in altar decorations
and as a garland for beasts led to the
sacrificial pyre. Virgil, in his Eclogues,
refers to it as a charm by which to recover
lost love. Plinius states that no
plant has been more honored than the
Verbena among the Romans. Mr.
Knight, in his biography of Shakespeare,
says: &ldquo;Some of the children said that
a horseshoe over the door, and Vervain
and dill, would preserve them, as they
had been told, from the devices of sorcery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The genus Verbena includes about one
hundred and ten species, often of a weedy
character. They are chiefly American.
In fact, in 1836, Loudon spoke of the
Verbenas as &ldquo;a genus of weedy plants.&rdquo;
At the present time this statement is
not true of many species, for under the
florist&rsquo;s influence they have been brought
to a high degree of perfection and they
are well thought of as ornamental plants.
Even in Loudon&rsquo;s time there grew on the
prairies of South America several species
of great beauty which he would not have
classed as weeds had he been familiar
with them.</p>
<p>The Blue Vervain is one of the weedy
members of the genus. It is common
along our waysides and with its erect
form and long spikes of blue flowers
would be quite attractive could the flowers
all mature at the same time. It has
frequently been placed under cultivation,
but has but little value as a garden
flower. But in the waste grounds of
roadsides it is a pleasing sight even if its
leaves are gray with dust.</p>
<p>This plant is sometimes called Simpler&rsquo;s
Joy. It was given this name because
in years gone by it was a popular
herb with the &ldquo;simplers,&rdquo; or gatherers
of medicinal plants.</p>
<h2 id="c20">THE BLUE SPRING DAISY.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Erigeron pulchellus.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>Daisy-like and modest, is not the name
the Blue Spring Daisy much more appropriate
for this hardy little plant than Robin&rsquo;s
or Poor Robin&rsquo;s Plantain, by which
it is often known? What has it to do
with the robin? To be sure it sends
forth its stems and blossoms in April
when the birds are happiest, yet the robins
appear much earlier. Then, too, the robins
are not poor, for they are the best
cared for among birds. Its flowers are
often of a bluish cast, though they may
be violet or even nearly white; they appear
in the spring and are daisy-like.</p>

<p>The botanist knows this plant of the
hills and banks as one of the species of
the genus Erigeron. This name is indicative
of one of its characteristics. It
is from two Greek words meaning spring
and old man. Old man in the springs or
early old is an appropriate name, for the
young plants are quite hoary and this
hairiness remains throughout its life.</p>
<p>The Blue Spring Daisy is not alone,
for it has about one hundred and thirty
sister species widely distributed throughout
the world, but they are more abundant
in the Americas, nearly seventy of
these occurring in North America.</p>
<p>This unassuming plant frequently
grows in large patches, yet does not
crowd its fellows; often it grows in localities
which the more delicate and brilliant
of the early flowers are wont to
shun. This may have been the theme
which inspired these lines of the poet:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I love the lowly children of the earth!</p>
<p class="t">I linger &rsquo;mid their artless ways</p>
<p class="t0">To feel their kinship and their fragile worth,</p>
<p class="t">And catch their speechless praise.</p>
</div>
<p>Though the species of Erigeron are
coarse growing and unpretentious plants,
they lend themselves readily to garden
cultivation. They are easily propagated
and make good borders, for they are
much more beautiful when massed than
when allowed to develop as single plants.
The forms vary greatly in color&mdash;orange,
creamy, white, rose, violet, purple and
bluish illustrate the range of color. The
yellow centers heighten the color effect.</p>
<p>The flowers resemble those of the asters
and the Blue Spring Daisy might be
mistaken for an Aster. But few of the
Asters, however, blossom earlier than the
month of August and none before July,
and the Spring Daisy does not blossom,
as a rule, later than in June.</p>
<p>Miss Lounsberry says: &ldquo;What
strange idea filled the pretty head of
Robin&rsquo;s Plantain when it decked itself
out to look like an Aster we do not
know, but its deception is very transparent
and we readily discover that it is not
one of the Asters.&rdquo; May we not look
upon it as the harbinger of the true Astors?</p>

<h2 id="c22">THE COTTON PLANT.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Gossypium barbadense</i>, L.)</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Theise men ben the beste worchers of Gold, Sylver, Cottoun, Sylk and of all such things
of any other, that be in the World.</p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Mandeville, Travels, p. 212.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cotton plant is undoubtedly one
of the most useful plants in the entire
vegetable kingdom. As with other exceedingly
useful, though common things,
we are so accustomed to the blessings we
owe to this plant that we almost entirely
lose sight of its identity and very existence.</p>
<p>There are a number of cotton yielding
plants which belong to the genus Gossypium
of the Mallow family (Malvace&aelig;),
the same family to which the Hibiscus
and garden mallows belong. The most
important species are G. barbadense,
which yields the noted Sea Island cotton,
and G. herbaceum. Both are extensively
cultivated in the United States, the latter
species more than the former. Other
more or less cultivated species are G. arboreum,
G. religiosum and G. punctatum.
The cottons are handsome plants with
large, showy yellow or purple flowers.
They vary from comparatively small and
herbaceous to shrubby or even approaching
the dimensions of trees. The seeds
are borne in a three to five lobed capsule,
which ruptures at maturity, thus
allowing the snow-white cotton head to
appear. The outer surface of the seeds
is covered with slender fibers, each fiber
being simply a single, greatly elongated
epidermal cell. The individual fiber is
flattened, twisted upon its axis, flexuous,
from one to two or three inches in length.
These fibers constitute the cotton of the
market, which finds so many important
uses in human economy. Of course primarily
nature intended these fibers for
the special use of the plant itself; being
a means of aiding in the distribution of
the seeds, and no doubt also serving as a
protection against being eaten by animals,
as the dense, more or less intertwined
growth of insipid, tenacious fibers
constitute anything but a tempting morsel.
Man, by his ingenuity and skill, has
been enabled to utilize this product of
nature in his own behalf.</p>
<p>The commercial and technical uses of
cotton date back to very remote antiquity.
Cotton fabrics were in use in China
as early as 2300 B. C. At the discovery
of America, beautiful cotton fabrics were
found in Brazil, Peru, Mexico and the
West Indies. According to the eminent
Greek historian and traveler, Herodotus,
cotton clothing was quite universally
worn 484 B. C. The finest cloth came
from the valleys of the Ganges, and not
until the close of the campaigns of Alexander
the Great did the manufacture of
cotton cloth become a distinctive industry
in Greece. It appears that during the
time of Pharaoh cotton was yet a rare
article since it is recorded that this
eminent ruler presented Joseph with a
costly coat made of this material, as a
memento of high esteem. It is also a
notable fact that the Egyptian mummies
are swathed in linen instead of cotton
cloth. No cotton seeds have ever been
found in the ancient tombs of Egypt, nor
is the plant represented upon the ancient
mural paintings of that country.</p>
<p>In the eastern continent India was no
doubt the principal cotton growing country;
even China obtained its principal
supply from that source. Not until about
the ninth century of our era was cotton
extensively cultivated in China. About
the second century Arabian merchants
brought cotton from India and began to
cultivate it in the vicinity of the Red Sea,
and from thence it gradually found its
way into Spain about the sixteenth century,
and from Spain into Italy and
Greece.</p>
<p>No one knows exactly when cotton
began to be used and cultivated in the
western continent; we know that it must
have been used a long time before the
discovery of America by Columbus, for
reasons already given. Mexican and
South American mummy cloth is found
to consist largely of cotton.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>Cotton is now extensively cultivated
in the warmer countries of both hemi-spheres&mdash;in
the southern United States
since the sixteenth century. The cotton
plant is in reality a perennial, becoming
quite shrubby with age, but in cultivation
it is treated as an annual, being grown
from seeds planted each spring. Three
or four seeds are planted to each hill, the
hills being about three feet apart. After
sprouting the weaker individuals are removed,
and at the end of three or four
months the remaining carefully cultivated
plants are pruned to make them
more spreading and give a better yield
of cotton. The plants grow quite rapidly,
the cotton maturing about five months
after planting. With the exception of the
pruning, the planting and cultivation of
cotton in the southern states is not unlike
the planting and cultivation of corn in
the middle states.</p>
<p>The cotton is picked by hand into bags
or baskets, spread out and dried, and
finally carted to the cotton gin, a machine
invented by Eli Whitney (1793), which
separates the fibers from the seeds. The
cotton is now pressed into bales, weighing
from 400 to 500 pounds, for shipment.
The cotton fiber is subjected to
further processes of cleaning, carding,
etc., before it is ready to be manufactured
into cloth fabrics, thread, etc.</p>
<p>Nearly all parts of the cotton plant
find a use. After the cotton is picked,
the stalks are burnt upon the fields or
&ldquo;plowed under&rdquo; to serve as a fertilizer
for the soil, which would otherwise become
impoverished very rapidly. The
bark of the root is collected and employed
medicinally, its medicinal properties
being highly lauded by the negroes
of the South. The seeds yield the cottonseed
oil, which is not unlike olive oil.
This oil, however, varies in purity, the
purest being used as an adulterant of
olive oil or as a substitute for this oil.
The less pure grades are used for burning,
but more in the preparation of woollen
cloth and morocco leather, also as a
lubricant for machinery. It is also used
as a substitute for almond oil and olive
oil in many pharmaceutical preparations
and in the manufacture of soap. The
seeds from which the oil has been expressed
constitute the cottonseed cake,
used as a nutritious cattle fodder. In the
South a tea made from the seeds is considered
a useful remedy in the treatment
of malaria and dysentery. A tea made
from the leaves is much used medicinally
in Jamaica and other islands of the West
Indies.</p>
<p>It is, however, the fiber, or cotton,
which is the important part of the plant.
It would be a tedious and difficult task to
describe, or even enumerate, all of the
uses to which it is put. It is used as
wadding in clothing and quilts. It is
used by the bacteriologist in the filtration
of air; air passed through a layer of
cotton is germ free. It is also used in
the filtration of liquids. Purified and
variously prepared, cotton is almost indispensable
in surgery. It forms an excellent
protective covering for wounds,
ulcers, burns and scalds. It absorbs secretions
and arrests hemorrhages. It is
used in the preparation of gun cotton
(pyroxylin) nitro-cellulose, collodion and
flexible collodion. Gun cotton is prepared
by treating cotton with strong
nitric acid and is used in gunnery, blasting
and in photography. Collodion (collodium)
and flexible collodion are used
in surgery, in the treatment of ulcers,
skin diseases, to arrest hemorrhages, applied
to inflamed areas, etc.</p>
<p>The most important part of the entire
plant is the fiber or cotton as it is used in
the manufacture of cloth. The modern
method of cotton manufacture does not
date back further than 1760. Prior to
that time weaving and spinning were altogether
domestic. At first the work was
done by means of the ancient distaff and
spindle, more recently the spinning
wheel. By these only one thread could
be produced at a time and, as may be
imagined, the process was very slow.
Furthermore, the yarn produced was inferior.
A fairly good thread could be
spun from flax, but the softness, shortness
and unevenness of the cotton fiber
made it difficult to produce a good uniform
yarn by means of such crude apparatus.
In fact, so poor was the yarn
<span class="pb" id="Page_236">236</span>
produced that in weaving it was used
only for the weft (transverse thread),
while linen, woolen or worsted yarn was
used for the warp (longitudinal thread),
in order that the cloth might have sufficient
durability. During the middle of
the eighteenth century the machinery for
spinning was much more imperfect than
the machinery for weaving. As a consequence,
it became necessary to produce
better spinning machines. In 1767 Hargreaves
invented the &ldquo;jenny&rdquo; which spun
eight threads at a time. In 1769 Arkwright
invented the &ldquo;waterframe,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;throstle,&rdquo; by means of which a much
firmer yarn was produced. In 1785 Dr.
Cartwright invented the &ldquo;power loom,&rdquo;
which far surpassed any previous spinning
machine. Other improvements were
added from time to time, culminating in
our highly perfected modern machines,
which would require volumes for a complete
description. We have machines
with thousands of spindles. It is possible
to weave a thread one thousand
miles or more in length, yet weighing but
one pound.</p>
<p>The raw cotton must be subjected to
various processes before it is ready for
spinning. The bales are opened and the
cotton sorted, so as to insure a uniform
quality. It is then passed through a
scutching, willowing or cleaning machine,
where all impurities and undesirable
foreign particles are removed. Next
it is passed through a carding machine,
which straightens out the fibers and lays
them parallel. It also passes through
the spreading machine, roving machine
and finally to the spinning machine.</p>
<p>The finer yarns are spun from Sea
Island cotton, from which fine muslins,
laces, etc., are made. This cotton has
long fibers. The good qualities of short
cottons are used in the manufacture of
cambrics, calicoes, sheetings, shirtings,
etc. Inferior grades of cotton are used
for coarse yarns in the manufacture of
coarse fabrics. Cotton is also mixed
with wool. Yorkshire broadcloth is said
to be about half cotton. From warps of
cotton and wefts of wool or worsted (a
variety of wool) are formed Orleans
cloths, Coburgs, mousselines de laine,
damasks, etc. There are also fabrics
composed of silk and cotton, linen and
cotton, alpaca and cotton, etc. It is used
in the manufacture of cotton thread for
sewing and pack thread for tying bundles,
and other cordage.</p>

<h2>Transcriber&rsquo;s Note on Linking between eBooks</h2>
<p>This eBook contains &ldquo;relative&rdquo; links to other Project Gutenberg eBooks. These
links function correctly whether the books are read online, or copied to a directory on a local drive or a web.</p>

<p>To install these books in another file system, create a subdirectory for each eBook, as in this
outline:</p>

<dl class="undent">

<dd class="t2">images/</dd>
<dd class="t3">...</dd>
<dd>...</dd>
</dl>

<p>Each eBook is in a separate directory; its directory name is the Project Gutenberg number for the eBook.</p>

<p>Each eBook directory may contain files in various formats; only the HTML files are relevant here; other files
are optional.</p>

<p>HTML files are in a subdirectory consisting of the Gutenberg number followed by &ldquo;-h&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The HTML file itself has a name consisting of the Gutenberg number followed by &ldquo;-h&rdquo;,
with a file extension of &ldquo;.htm&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Associated media files (such as images, MIDI files, etc.) are contained in a further
